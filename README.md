## Welcome to readme!

Hi! I just want to thank you for your interest in this plugin. I put a lot of effort into this project and I would really love someone to use it!

### Minecraft version

This plugin runs on a Minecraft version 1.16+.

## What is Manhunt?

There are two teams: hunters and speedrunners. Hunters have to kill all the speedrunners before one of them beats the ender dragon. Hunters can locate speedrunners using a compass.

## Features

- Speedrunners-tracking compass: Hunters receive a special compass at the start to be able to locate speedrunners
- When a speedrunner is in a different dimension, compass will say it and will track their portal
- Compass has two modes:
- - Tracks every speedrunner individually
- - Or tracks the nearest one

## How to use it

- drag the .jar file from the [Release tab](https://github.com/Matistan/MinecraftManhunt/releases) to your plugins folder on your server.
- select players to your game using `/manhunt add <player_name> <role>` command
- type `/manhunt start` to start the match!

## Commands

- /manhunt add <player name> <role> - adds a player with a specified role
- /manhunt remove <player name> - removes a player
- /manhunt start - starts a game
- /manhunt reset - resets a game
- /manhunt pause - pauses a game
